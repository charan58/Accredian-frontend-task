              **Login Form:**
              <ul>
                <li>Username or Email (mandatory)</li>
                <li>Password (mandatory)</li>
              </ul>

              **Sign-Up Form:**
              <ul>
                <li>Username (mandatory)</li>
                <li>Email (mandatory)</li>
                <li>Password (mandatory)</li>
                <li>Confirm Password (mandatory)</li>
              </ul>

              *Design Considerations:*
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To achieve a modern and visually appealing design, Material-UI is leveraged for building components. The implementation includes form validation for mandatory fields, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
                </li>
              </ul>

              This web application is singularly focused on developing robust RESTful APIs for user authentication â€“ both login and sign-up. Leveraging Express.js for the backend server, the commitment is to deliver a seamless user experience.

              **REST APIs for User Authentication:**
              <ul>
                <li>Create RESTful endpoints for user login and sign-up.</li>
              </ul>

              **Database Connectivity:**
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To ensure the security and integrity of user data, a solid connection is established between APIs and a MySQL database. The commitment to user privacy is evident in the proper handling of data, including the implementation of password encryption.
                </li>
              </ul>

              **Error Handling:**
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The system is equipped with comprehensive error handling mechanisms, from handling invalid credentials during login to preventing duplicate email entries during sign-up. This ensures a smooth and error-free user experience.
                </li>
              </ul>

              Join us on this journey as we shape the future of our platform, combining cutting-edge technology with an unwavering commitment to user satisfaction. We are at the forefront of these efforts, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for every user.
